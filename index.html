			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Izuku Midoriya (緑みどり谷や出いず久く Midoriya Izuku?), also known as
				Deku (デク Deku?), is the main protagonist of the My Hero Academia manga
				and anime series.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though Izuku was born Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention
				of the legendary hero All Might due to his innate heroism and a strong
				sense of justice, and has since become his close pupil, as well as a
				student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. All Might passed on his
				transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him the ninth holder of One For All.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following the Paranormal Liberation War, with Tomura Shigaraki and All
				For One actively targeting Izuku for his Quirk, he decides to leave U.A.
				before finishing his first year to keep his classmates out of harm's
				way.[4] After encouragement from his friends, he later returns to U.A.
